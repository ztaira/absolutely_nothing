<p>As all programmers know, there are many modules that do Absolutely Nothing. However, this is largely by accident; those modules don't <em>intend</em> to do Absolutely Nothing. So, naturally, they aren't the best at it. </p>

<p>This module, on the other hand, is <strong>purpose-built</strong> to do Absolutely Nothing. As a result, it does Absolutely Nothing in the most efficient way possible, and achieves this in only one line of code. The entire codebase has also been written with scalability in mind: Because of this, it runs in constant time, eliminating any worries about negatively affecting performance as projects scale up. </p>

<h2>
<a id="zero-dependencies" class="anchor" href="#zero-dependencies" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Zero Dependencies</h2>

<p>This code is completely self-contained: You won't have to worry about anything breaking, ever. It's compatible with all versions of Python, running on any machine, with any operating system. It's also designed to fail as gracefully as possible, so if this code breaks, the rest of your code will be unaffected as a result. It's an extremely elegant solution to a very nonexistent problem. </p>

<a id="cryptographically-secure" class="anchor" href="#cryptographically-secure" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Cryptographically Secure</h2>

<p>With all the news in the media about security breaches and various types of malware, one has to be mindful of security when designing or redesigning any project. Thankfully, we've got your back. All 1 line(s) of code in this module have been peer-reviewed to ensure that there are no possible vulnerabilities for any hacker to exploit. </p>
